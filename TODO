TODO:
- Update to be able to be in multiple servers at a time
- Refactor help command to use built in usage attribute (see: https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/discordrb/Discordrb%2FCommands%2FCommandContainer%3Acommand)
Ideas:
- Upload a random berserk page?
- Create a p!top command that tracks users scores by the number of characters they've typed
- Weather command (fetches data from openweathermap.org) w/ air quality index (aqi)
- Search the quote DB to see if a string exists
- Delete quotes?
