TODO:
- Update to be able to be in multiple servers at a time
- Refactor commands to have one per file, in commands directory with all files in that directory included by the main puck.rb
- Refactor help command to use built in usage attribute (see: https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/discordrb/Discordrb%2FCommands%2FCommandContainer%3Acommand)
Ideas:
- Upload a random berserk page?
