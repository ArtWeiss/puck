TODO:
- Update top command to use embeds (https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/)
- Update fortune command to use embeds as well
- Refactor help command to use built in usage attribute (see: https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/discordrb/Discordrb%2FCommands%2FCommandContainer%3Acommand)
Ideas:
- p!doubt command that sends doubt.jpg
- Upload a random berserk page? Can use Bot.send_file to send images
- Weather command (fetches data from openweathermap.org) w/ air quality index (aqi)
- Delete quotes?
- Markov chain generation
    - For the last hour of chat?
    - From a random subset of quotes?
    - From all chat history?
    - https://github.com/zolrath/marky_markov looks promising
- Puck tip of the day
    - Posts once a day at a specific (or random time) a tip on what puck can do
