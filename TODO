TODO:
- Refactor help command to use built in usage attribute (see: https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/discordrb/Discordrb%2FCommands%2FCommandContainer%3Acommand)
Ideas:
- Upload a random berserk page? Can use Bot.send_file to send images
- Markov chain generation
    - For the last hour of chat?
    - From a random subset of quotes?
    - From all chat history?
    - https://github.com/zolrath/marky_markov looks promising
- Puck tip of the day
    - Posts once a day at a specific (or random time) a tip on what puck can do
